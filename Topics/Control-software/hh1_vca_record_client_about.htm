        <p>The client recording feature lets you record selected video segments for storage on a USB 3 external memory device that is connected to the video computer.</p>
        <p>Client recording does not interfere with or substitute for continuous backup recording on the video computerâ€™s internal drives. Continuous backup recording happens in addition to any client recording that is being done.</p>
        <p>Because you start and stop client recording to capture video of specific parts of an operation, and because the video segments go automatically onto an external memory device, client recording can save you time in sorting through and then exporting video segments on the internal drives.</p>
        <p>You can manage external memory devices for client recording from the Video Computer App DRIVE MANAGEMENT screen.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can specify that client recording be done for multiple video streams (views from different cameras) at the same time. In this case, all of the video streams are copied onto all external memory devices that you have enabled for recording.</p>
        <p>The video on a client recording segment always exactly matches the content of the backup video segment that was being recorded on the video computer internal drives at the same time.</p>
